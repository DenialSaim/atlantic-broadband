 Login Instructions for Atlantic Broadband
 Go to the official Atlantic Broadband website (now called Breezeline) to sign in; the URL will redirect you.  To access your account, go to the homepage and look for the "Login" button on the top right.  There you can input your login credentials after selecting your service type (residential or business).

 Create an account before you can use the portal for the first time.  In order to confirm your identification, click the "Register" link and provide your email, account number, and other personal details.  After your profile is created, you will receive new login credentials that you can use to access your account.

 Password Reset for Atlantic Broadband Users
 Everyone, at some point, forgets their login information.  You shouldn't freak out if you've forgotten your login credentials.  Select "Forgot Password" or "Forgot Username" from the login page, and then proceed with the on-screen instructions.  In order to retrieve your account, you will get an email containing either a reset link or instructions.

 If you want to keep your data safe, you need to choose a strong password.  To further beef up security, changing your password from time to time is highly recommended.

 What Are Your Options After Logging In?
 Access a wealth of tools and services after logging onto the Atlantic Broadband login portal.  The billing tab is a highly trafficked area.  Here you may manage your payment information, see all of your invoices (current and previous), and even set up automated payments.

 You can also handle extra services, such as premium channels or high-speed internet boosts, as well as examine your service package and upgrade or downgrade plans.  Remotely resetting your modem, managing linked devices, or scheduling a service appointment are all made easy on the platform.

 You can send a support ticket for quicker assistance or use the support center within your account to troubleshoot common difficulties if you're encountering technical issues.

 Logging in using the Breezeline App
 An upgraded mobile app was released alongside the rebranding of Atlantic Broadband to Breezeline.  If you own an iOS or Android device, you can get the Breezeline app.  When it's finished installing, enter your credentials used for the web portal to log in.

 Viewing invoices, modifying Wi-Fi settings, contacting support, and checking for outages in your area are among account control capabilities that the app offers.  Using it, you may easily manage your account from anywhere.

 Typical Login Problems and Their Solutions
 Login problems with Atlantic Broadband do occur from time to time.  Incorrect credentials, passwords that have expired, or out-of-date browsers are the most prevalent causes.  Clearing your browser's cache, installing the most recent version, or trying a different browser might solve your problem.

 Before you try to log in, make sure your internet connection is stable.  Multiple failed login attempts are probably to blame if your account seems to be locked.  You can either contact us for assistance or wait a few minutes before trying again.

 Helpful Hints for an Easy Login
 Save your credentials in a safe password manager and bookmark the login page for future convenience.  For added security, enable two-factor authentication if it is offered.  For the security of your account, remember to log out whenever you use a shared or public device.
